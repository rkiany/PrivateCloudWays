# Hypervisors

We tried to use VMware as our hypervisor, but once we saw the price quotes, we decided to search more! I had some experience with Xen in the past, but I was not sure about it for production use. So, I searched more and was recommended an Open Source Hypervisor called Proxmox VE. This software is a good middle ground between price (annual subscription) and functionality that we needed. Proxmox provides great stability and system at a fraction of the cost that VMware was asking for. The learning curve for learning this new software was not bad and very doable. Proxmox can create a Cluster when you have more than one server and can manage your VMs and hardware across all your physicall servers from a single dashboard without any extra peice of managment software. Everything managment related is syncronyzed across all the Proxmox nodes as long as you keep the quorom (more than half of your physical servers are operational with min operational system of 3 nodes). So, if you have 4 physicall servers, you can only loose one box and still maintain quorom.

Next is talking to the Hypervisor using a tool such as Terraform. For Proxmox, there is a driver/provider named Telmate/proxmox that talks to the Rest API point of your Proxmox cluster and can spin up VMs and manage them. Please note that Proxmox also supports LXC (system containers) which are very fast and fun to use.
