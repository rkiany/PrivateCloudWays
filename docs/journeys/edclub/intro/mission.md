# Our Mission

## What Are We Doing?
We are hosting an education platform as a SaaS. Our aim is to provide an efficient and affordable solution for our users.

## Why Are We Doing It?
Our goal is to make the platform fast and cost-effective, allowing us to keep prices low for our customers and remain competitive in the market.

## Are We Hosting Everything Ourselves?
No, we utilize various services, including AWS and Google services, to complement technologies that can be cheaply outsourced and require significant technical challenges. We consider raw compute and networking as low-hanging fruit, which we handle ourselves despite the substantial costs. On the other hand, features like Text-to-Speech and AI are highly complex and better outsourced. Database management can be expensive and may be managed in-house or outsourced depending on the specific database being used.

## What Are the Challenges?
There are numerous challenges, including:
- Deciding on the right hypervisor and tooling.
- Making informed choices on what and where to buy hardware.
- Configuring systems efficiently.
- Managing extensive networking tasks.
- Balancing cost and performance in our decisions.

## Our Mission
We aim to share our experiences with the world. We want to help others by providing insights and assistance. If you need help building your infrastructure, we're happy to assist.

Join us as we navigate the complexities of building and maintaining an efficient, cost-effective platform!
