## Our Assumptions

### Our Situation
1. **High Hosting Costs**:
   Our hosting costs were over $30K per month, which prompted us to seek more cost-effective solutions.
2. **Hosting a Website/App**:
   We are responsible for hosting edclub websites and application.
3. **Need for High Availability**:
   Almost all components of our infrastructure need to be highly available to ensure uninterrupted service for our users.

### Assumptions Made
1. **Cost Efficiency**:
   By moving away from expensive cloud services, we can significantly reduce our operational costs.
2. **Control and Customization**:
   Hosting our own infrastructure allows us greater control and the ability to tailor solutions specifically to our needs.
3. **Reliability**:
   Even though we are hosting many components ourselves, we still rely on services like AWS and Google to ensure reliability and performance.
4. **Scalability**:
   Our setup must be scalable to accommodate future growth and increased user demand.
5. **Technical Expertise**:
   Managing our own infrastructure requires a high level of technical expertise, particularly in areas like networking, hardware configuration, and high availability setups.
6. **DataCenter Expertise** 
   We are not going to host our application at our DataCenter. We only rely on replutable and secure DataCenters.

By making these assumptions, we aim to build a robust, cost-effective infrastructure that meets our needs and provides valuable insights for others.
