# Our Story

Over the past year and a half, while working on [edclub](https://www.edclub.com) infrastructure, we've reduced our AWS costs from $30,000/month to under $1,000/month by moving our databases, web servers, and caches off AWS. During this process, we learned to navigate complex systems like Proxmox VE and PostgreSQL HA, mastering network and firewall setups.

Why move away from the cloud? For us, it was about cost efficiency and control. This transition has been rewarding beyond just saving money. We still use AWS services but not for basic tasks.

Is it wise to move away from major cloud providers? It depends on your scale and needs. The journey involves mastering advanced networking and database management. However, the result is a more resilient, cost-effective infrastructure. We're creating a community-driven site to share our experiences and lessons learned, helping others who want to embark on this path. Join us as we demystify the process and empower businesses to take control of their tech destinies.
